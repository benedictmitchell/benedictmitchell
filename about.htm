<blockquote>Benedict Mitchell is an artist based in Parramatta in Western Sydney.</a>
<br>
<br>
Benedict's practice is primarily concerned with the representation of everyday objects and behaviours in the Australian context.
<br>
<br>
Benedict creates sculpture and wall hangings primarily using papier mache, clay, and pastels; pieces which he encourages to be enjoyed within the home.
<br>
<br>
His experience growing up in the Blue Mountains has fostered an appreciation and respect for natural resources in his work.
<br>
<br>
Benedict wishes he still had his 1999 model mazda 323 which "ran like a champ" and one day hopes for his older brother to let him have a turn on the playstation.
<br>
<br>
When not creating art, Benedict spends his time collecting photos of gerry harvey from old newspapers and reading the minutes of past annual general meetings from the revesby workers club.
<br>
<br>
Multiple sources can verify that Benedict has never seen a toyota tarago in person and cannot taste the difference between sand and dirt.
