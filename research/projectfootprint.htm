<blockquote><i>Project Footprint</i> is an exploration into the development of cheaper and more effective orthotic insoles using 3D printing.
<br>
<br>
In 2015, inspired by my own negative experiences with the extreme cost and inadequate production methods of orthotic insoles, I set about investigating the ways in which I could possibly improve the experience for myself and others using my knowledge as a product designer and in 3D printing technology.
By exploring how existing orthotics were produced and reflecting on my own experience, I identified a number of problem areas that could be improved, along with a number of opportunities for new applications that could be employed in relation to customised manufacturing and footwear.
<br>
<br>
<b>Existing problems:</b>
<br>
<br>
- The cost of orthotics, often up to several hundreds of dollars for something with materially little value (foam and rigid plastics).
<br>
<br>
- Crude means of production and little adjustability before manufacture. The software used by podiatrists gave little option to adjust the scans before sending the files to be manufactured.
<br>
<br>
- Crude means of adjustment after manufacture. If the orthotic insoles did not fit correctly, either new ones had to be produced (with several weeks turnaround time) or they were adjusted by means of a grinder (in the case of hard plastic) or a craft knife (in the case of foam insoles)
<br>
<br>
- Long turnaround times for production and delivery. Whilst the scanning is conducted in-house, the production of the insoles can occur overseas and result in up to several weeks of pain and discomfort as the patient waits for delivery.</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<b>Opportunities:</b>
<br>
<br>
- A cheaper means for orthotic production through 3D printing.
<br>
<br>
- A shorter turnaround between pre-production scanning and delivery. Podiatrists can have access to a 3D printer and use this to generate insoles that can be delivered within days or even hours, as opposed to weeks as in the current method.
<br>
<br>
- A different manufacturing method such as 3D printing allows for the design and development of adjustable orthotics to ensure a better fit and biomechanical result.
<br>
<br>
- Applications of 3D-printed orthotic insoles could easily be translated to the product of whole footwear such as 3D-printed shoes or football boots, for example.
<br>
<br>
Using an ordinary CanoScan LiDE 700F flatbed scanner, an UP Mini 3D printer, and a number of software tools (Blender, Autodesk Meshmixer, and Solidworks), I was able to devise a number of techniques that allowed for the manufacture of 3D-printed insoles that perfectly fit my feet without requiring any adjustment after production.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Above: the resulting models, when printed at full-scale, are able to perfectly fit a user's foot without any post-production adjustments.</i>
<br>
<br>
By importing a scan of my foot into Blender, I was able to assign a depth value to each pixel in the image according to its light and dark areas, which enabled me to create a surface profile of my foot that can be used to replicate the design of current orthotics or can be used in new applications such as slim orthotics in football boots (see below) or in whole footwear such as shoes or football boots that could be 3D-printed to a user's needs.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>The use of these techniques show a clear benefit over existing methods along with an interesting scope for potential future exploration in the previously-mentioned applications in addition to the use of other 3D-printing materials, such as flexible filaments or in arrangements that allow variable densities to be employed within the structure of a model, creating products that can better suit the human body at a cheaper cost and with a faster turnaround time.
<br>
<br>
More accessible customisable insoles is not only beneficial for medical patients but also to average individuals, for whom custom insoles would allow them to purchase and immediately wear a new pair of shoes without any of the issues of discomfort associated with the common "breaking-in" period.
<br>
<br>
I see the use of 3D printing in medical applications as becoming more prominent and accessible in the coming years, particularly if the production of products can be conducted on-site at the office of a consultant, which would greatly improve the communication between the professional and the patient whilst also significantly improving the patient experience.
